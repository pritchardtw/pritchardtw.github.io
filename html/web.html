            Big Deals is an app I'm trying to create. When I say app I mean web and mobile app. The typical pattern is to create a Web App and API. After that you can create an Android and iOS app leveraging the API. I think for this I'm going to try to expedite a bit and use Meteor and create an HTML + JavaScript app that will work in Web, Android, and iOS.
            Currently I'm just researching technologies to figure out which I'd like to use. I started with the MEAN stack, and after some googling I found Meteor and thought that might be worth exploring. I'll update my site as I progress on this project.

            I created baywatch to save my employer $832,000.00/year as a side project at work. There was no centralized tool to live monitor our system configurations, and we often found ourselves manually ssh-ing into each system to find out the information. The system software and hardware are often changing, and this app will tell you the current system configuration with data that is no older than 5 minutes. </br></br>

            The web app was written using the Flask framework for Python. I used sqlalchemy as an Object Relational Mapping tool with an sqlite database to hold the system information. I created a Python service using parmiko that ssh's into the systems in the database every 5 minutes and updates the database with the latest information. The web app then interfaces to the database to perform all CRUD operations. A user can add a system to the app by providing a name and IP. They can edit an existing system's name or IP. Finally, they can delete a bay if it is no longer relevant. </br></br>

            The best part about baywatch is the name. Our systems are called 'Bays', and it's watching the status of the bays. So, Baywatch! Oh and also the part where it saves about 400 people from manually performing 10 minutes of ssh-ing a day. Assuming an average salary of a typical user (engineers, program managers, functional managers) is $100,000.00/year or $8.00/10 minutes, that's $3,200.00/day, or $832,000.00/year. </br></br>

            I temporarily changed the font for the screen shot.

            This web page is my first web project. I completed the codeacademy 'Deploy a Website', 
            'Learn HTML & CSS: Part I', and 'Learn JavaScript' before creating it.<br /><br />
            
            The page is hosted by github, and I used Amazon Web Service: Route 53 to acquire the domain
            name and setup a hosted zone.<br /><br />

            The twitter bootstrap framework was used for the side-nav-bar and some of the layout.
            I used Visual Studio as the IDE. The fonts are from google fonts.<br /><br />

            I tried to make sure the page works well on mobile and dektop, so if you're curious
            check it out on both mediums.
