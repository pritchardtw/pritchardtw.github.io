        <p>I learned enough android to make my first original app! Backgroundify! Below you can see Backgroundify in my Galaxy S6. Backgroundify will set your device's wallpaper to any website you specify. What's neat is it will auto update the wallpaper at a specified interval as well.</br></br>
        Backgroundify is to a point where I have an MVP and the next step I'd like to do is figure out monetization. The free version will allow auto update at a frequency of once per day or less. The $0.99 app will allow auto update at up to a 1 minute interval and also allow you to set the lock screen wallpaper. (Setting the lock screen wallpaper is only available in devices running android api 24 or later).</br></br>
        If Backgroundify became popular enough I would expand it in the following ways. First I would implement preferences that allow you to specify websites for each individual wallpaper. Each of those would be able to update at their own frequency. Then I would consider adding multiple url's to each wallpaper so each desktop can cycle through their own images. Finally, if backgroundify was really popular, I could make a website where users upload their own images or pick from stock photos. They would login to their account on the site and the android app and they could customize their backgrounds through the webpage. At this point I think it would be worthy of a monthly subscription service.

            When it opens the user is presented with the main activity which just contains a settings fragment. This settings fragment stores the user preferences url, frequency, and enabled or disabled.

            Below you see what it looks like when the user udpates the frequency setting.

            Udacity.com has an android programming course that I am taking. During the class we first learn a lesson in 1 small project, and then apply it to the overall course project, Sunshine. Below you can see Sunshine in my Galaxy S6.

            When it opens we have a 10 day forecast. The forecast data is generated by interfacing with a REST API serving up weather data. The view is a RecyclerView that has about 7 or 8 persistent views it's constantly binding data to from the JSON file received via our API. The recycler view is used because it teaches the most efficient way to display large amounts of data. Refresh triggers a refresh of the data by querying the REST API again. The MAP displays a map of the place we are getting weather data for using an implicit intent and the maps app. We are able to select a day of the week to trigger an explicit intent to display the forecast in a new activity.

            The new activity receives information from the initiating activity and displays the forecast. From this activity the user can Share the plain text weather information via an implicit intent which prompts the user to select an app to handle the request. For example, when I click share on my device I can share via Gmail, Messenger (text), or WhatsApp.

            I followed a udacity beginner android course to make my first app, the happy birthday app.
            <img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 285px" src="../images/application/happybirthdayapp.png" /><br/>
            It looks like this when it opens.
            <img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 285px" src="../images/application/appss.png" /><br/>
            It's a picture of my friend Derek, and the app wishes him a happy birthday. It provides a reminder that I, Tom, am wishing him a happy birthday,
            not Jack or Michael. This helps secure my position as #1 friend.<br/>
            <br/>
            Lessons learned in this course were using a relative layout, two text views, and an image view. We styled the text and images to have a nice modern format.
